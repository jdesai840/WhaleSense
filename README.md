# WhaleSense

This repository contains the Arduino C code for the Arduino Nano microcontroller that interfaces with the GPS and thermal camera pan tilt microcontroller, 
and the Arduino Nano microcontroller that interfaes with the LiDAR module and associated servo motor.

The repository also contains Python code which allows the Raspberry Pi to obtain image data from the thermal camera system, and code to generate time synchronized
data compiled from input from all of the sensors
